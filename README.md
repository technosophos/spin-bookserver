## Spin Bookserver

This is a simple example of using Python and Javascript together to make a two-function serverless app with Spin.

* Fetch this code
* `cd book-api` and do an `npm install`
* Set up your Python env and do a `pip install -t frontend/requirements.txt`

There is a blog post about this app on https://fermyon.com/blog
